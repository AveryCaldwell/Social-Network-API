# __Overview 📁__

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

### __User Experience 👤__

- Please use `npm i mongoose@6.9.2`
- You’ll use [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, a [MongoDB](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) database, and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) ODM.
- Run `npm run seed` to seed your database before testing with Insomnia.
- Run `npm run dev` to have the server automatically restart whenever changes are saved.
